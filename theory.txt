=> git init : initialize the git in the current directory
git init -b {main} = the git initialize with the branch name main

=> git status : used to check if any files are left untracked

=> git add {file_name.xxx} : To add the file to git first git will be init, then it would be added to the git staging environment and after adding then we can commit the changes with the message. to add the file to the git staging environment and to get track of this file and add it completely to git we have to commit it should]

=> git add . : moves all the untracked files to staging environment

=> git commit -m {"message"} : to commit the file in the main branch followed by the message that what change has been made.

=> git log : it shows what changes have been made or commits made with message

=> git commit -a -m {"message"} : -a is there to skip the staging part (git add {file name.xxx}) and directly commit the changes with the message

=> git diff {file name.xxx}: it shows what changes have been made since last commit and not updated.

=> git rm --{file_name.txt} : to remove a file from the git

=> git push origin main : after commiting the changes will not be shown on the branch or the github and this commands helps in pushing the commits to the specified branches (in this case the main branch).

=> git remote add origin "URL" : this command is used to move the local files to the github account in which first we have to create a new repo on our account then we will get a HTTPS link from there and paste it on the place or the URl

=> git branch : to check in which branch we are in currently

git branch -M main : to rename branch

=> git checkout -b {new_branch_name} : used to create a new branch

=> git checkout {branch name} : to navigate branch

=> git branch : to check the branch we are in

=> git branch -M main : to rename the branch

=> git checkout -d {branch_name} : to delete the branch

=> git diff {branch name} : to check difference between the branches (can also be done on Github itself)

=> git pull origin {branch_name} : to bring the changes in the current brnach from the (brnach_name).

=> git reset {filename} || git reset : if we've added the file in the staging area (add . ) then to unstage it we use this command and then it is not ready to commit (this command does not bring back the old code)

=> git reset HEAD~1 : when we done the staging as well as the commit and then if we have to remove the commit then we can use this command for a single file. The HEAD~1 in this is the latest commit we made {always the same} and we are reseting it

=> git reset {commit hash} : if we want to go more than one commit behind then we can use this command. In this command the hash is the long value which we get on performing git log and on whichever commit we want to go we just replace the hash in this command with the commit hash <--the commit looks like this {cfe14256ae65aa76e0ec0e0e9a15744ea7283886} -->
